  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella told LA NACION on 4
March that after his meeting with Foreign Office head Douglas
Hurd in London on 3 March, "he is absolutely convinced" that
Great Britain "sees Argentine-Chilean relations with good eyes."
  In a telephone call from the United Kingdom, the minister
analyzed the meeting and commented on an article about it, which
was published on 4 March. Di Tella said the British Government
"supports rapprochement between the two countries." He added
that if relations with Chile were good during President Aylwin's
administration "they will be very good during the Frei
administration, and will have still more impetus."
  It is hard to understand Di Tella's ideas, particularly the
emphasis given to British support of ties between Argentina and
Chile, if facts kept in absolute secrecy until 4 March are
ignored. These facts caused surprise and uneasiness among
official circles.
  The reason behind it was a donation.
  Argentina had to conduct diplomatic actions to clarify a
British donation to the Chilean Air Museum.
  The donation consists of a Harrier plane that still shows
where it was hit by Argentine bullets. The plane participated
in the Malvinas War. The donation will be officially made on 22
March, presided over by former iron lady Margaret Thatcher, who
will visit Santiago from 20 to 23 March.
  Some Argentine representatives of the media believe there is
the clear intention of affecting the good relations being
enjoyed by the two countries, seeking to revert to the times
when the theory of balanced forces -- sponsored by the large
producing centers -- was fervently complied with in Latin
America.
  As LA NACION reported, Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando
Petrella traveled to Chile practically the same day Di Tella
left for London. Chilean civilian officials who will soon be
installed allegedly knew nothing about the issue.
  Although Hurd's answer about the donation has not been made
public, the Argentine foreign minister said he had received
"full explanations" about the discussed issues.
  In Di Tella's opinion, following the almost 80-minute
private
meeting with his British counterpart on 3 March, the objective
of Thatcher's presence in Santiago are merely to sell her book
and give a paid lecture.
  Di Tella pragmatically said: "The possibility of receiving a
few dollars for a book should not be disdained."
  Di Tella said Hurd's upcoming visit to the Malvinas Islands
has only a relative political importance.
  The minister said his British counterpart mentioned to him
that he has not visited the islands during the five years he has
been in the government.
  His visit, however, could be interpreted as a sort of
political homage to the islanders, perhaps under pressure from
the Conservative Party's hard wing. He will be in Malvinas the
day marking the 12th anniversary of the arrival of Argentine
forces on the islands on 2 April 1982.
  During the telephone conversation, Di Tella gave the
impression that Hurd could explain to the islanders the
securities offered that "Great Britain is clearly seeking ways
to cooperate over oil exploration...if that is possible."
